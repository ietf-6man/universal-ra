    <abstract>

      <t>One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host
      configuration, was to configure the network-layer parameters
      only with IPv6 ND, and use service discovery for other
      configuration information. Unfortunately that hasn't panned out
      quite as planned, and we are in a situation where all kinds of
      configuration options are added to RAs and DHCP. This document
      proposes a new universal RA option in a self-describing data
      format, with the list of elements maintained in an IANA
      registry, with greatly relaxed rules for registration.</t>

    <!-- SECTION 1: Introduction -->

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document proposes a new universal option for the Router
      Advertisement IPv6 ND message <xref target="RFC4861"/>. It's
      purpose is to use the RA as an opaque carrier for configuration
      information between an agent on a router and host / host
      application.</t>

      <t>DHCP is suited to give per-client configuration information,
      while the RA mechanism advertises configuration information to
      all hosts on the link. There is a long running history of
      "conflict" between the two. The arguments go; there is less
      fate-sharing in DHCP, DHCP doesn't deal with multiple sources of
      information, or make it more difficult to change information
      independent of the lifetimes, RA cannot be used to configure
      different information to different clients and so on. And of
      course some options are only available in RAs and some options
      are only available in DHCP.</t>

      <t>While this proposal does not resolve the DHCP vs RA debate,
      it proposes an experimental solution to the problem of a very
      slow process of standardizing new options, and the IETF spending
      an inordinate amount of time arguing over new configuration
      options.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="The Experiment">
      <t>This document specifies a new "self-describing" universal RA
      option. Currently new configuration option requires "standards
      action".  The purpose of the experiment is two-fold. What are the
      implications of an opaque RA option that should not require any
      code changes for new elements within the option? And what
      happens when change control is relaxed? The proposal is that no
      IETF document is required. The configuration option is described
      directly in the universal RA IANA registry. The other part of
      the experiment is to </t>

      <t>Duration of experiment: 2 years.</t>

      <t>How to evaluate success? How many new options have been
      defined. Did expert review suffice to stop "harmful" options?
      Were any of the options implemented and deployed? On a successful
      experiment, the time limit of the registry will be removed and
      it's experimental status will be removed. If the experiment is
      deemed a failure, then the registry will be removed.</t>

	<t>The universal RA option MUST be small enough to fit within
	a single RA packet. It then follows that a single element in
	the dictionary cannot be larger than what fits within a
	single option. Different elements can be split across multiple
	universal RA options (in separate RA packets).</t>

	<t>All IANA registered elements are under the "ietf" key in
	the dictionary. Private configuration information can be
	included in the option using different keys.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Implementation Guidance">
      <t>The purpose of this option is to allow users to use the RA as
      an opaque carrier for configuration information without
      requiring code changes.</t>

      <t>On the router side there should be an API allowing a user to
      add an element, e.g. a JSON object or a pre-encoded CBOR string
      to RAs sent on a given interface.</t>

      <t>On the host side, an API should be available allowing
      applications to subscribe to received RA elements along with meta-data
      about the RA (e.g. source and destination IP addresses, receive
      timestamp, etc.). It should be possible to subscribe to receive the
      whole of an RA or any portion, e.g. based on a dictionary key.</t>

      <t>The contents of any elements that are not recognized, either in whole
      or in part, by the receiving host MUST be ignored and the remainder of
      option's contents processed as normal.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Implementation Status">
      <t>The Universal RA option sending side is implemented in VPP
      (https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP).</t>

      <t>The implementation is a prototype released under Apache
      license and available at:
      https://github.com/vpp-dev/vpp/commit/156db316565e77de30890f6e9b2630bd97b0d61d.</t>

    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Unless there is a security relationship between the host and
      the router (e.g. SEND), and even then, the consumer of
      configuration information can put no trust in the information
      received.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>IANA is requested to add a new registry for the Universal RA
      option. The registry should be named "IPv6 ND RA Universal
      option (experimental)". Changes and additions to the registry
      require expert review <xref target="RFC8126"/>.</t>

      <t>The schema field follows the CDDL schema definition in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-cbor-cddl"/>.</t>

      <t>The IANA is requested to
      add the universal option to the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option
      Formats" registry with the value of 42.</t>

      <section title="Initial objects in the registry">
	<t>The PVD <xref
	target="I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains"/> elements (and
	PIO, RIO <xref target="RFC4191"/>) are included to provide an
	alternative representation for the proposed new options in
	that draft.</t>
